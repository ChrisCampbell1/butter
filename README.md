## [Use Butter Here](https://butterapp.fly.dev/)

Butter is inspired by my love of cooking. As a home cook, I'm always looking for the best recipes I can find online. The problem is that when I find a truly great recipe and cook it over and over again, I usually end up tweaking the recipe over time. I don't have a paper cookbook in my kitchen to keep notes in so I usually end up forgetting exactly what I tweaked to make the recipe even better.

Butter is an online cookbook app that lets you search, save, and copy recipes that you can edit and leave notes on overtime. No more scrolling Google hoping to come across that recipe you made last year and no more guessing on if you used 2 or 3 tablespoons of turmeric in that curry you love. Keeping track of your favorite recipes is as easy as Butter.
